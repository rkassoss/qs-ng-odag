# Qlik Sense June 2018 Template
An AngularJS mashup, compatible with Qlik Sense June 2018 release.  
Run 'npm install'  
Run 'bower install'  
Run 'gulp build-dev'  
Run 'gulp watch'  

It should open your browser with livereload. I am trying to concat all the components, directives and services nicely but I'm still unsure how to add them to the app module in app.js
